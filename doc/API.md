# Mobile SDK Documentation

This file is for reference purposes only. It is intended for tracking the Mobile SDK documentation that should be displayed from the live Docs site. Like all API doc, the golden source of this code will live in this mobile-sdk repo, and will be edited in this repo.

## Documentation

* [SDK Downloads](downloads.md)
* [Mobile Platform Implementation](getting_started.md)
* [Mobile Apps and API Keys](currently a local file in the Docs repo... still analyzing this but the following files from this repo are not actual code libraries? May need to add as local doc files instead?  Still scoping)
* [Sample Apps](sampleapps.md)
* [Basic Map Components](common_tasks.md)
* [Map Listener Events](listener.md)
* [Managing Mobile Maps with CARTO APIs](carto.md)
