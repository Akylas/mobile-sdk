# Mobile SDK Documentation

This file is for reference purposes only. It is intended for tracking the Mobile SDK documentation that should be displayed from the live Docs site. Like all API doc, the golden source of this code will live in this mobile-sdk repo, and will be edited in this repo.

## Documentation

* [Getting Started](getting_started.md)
* [SDK and other CARTO Tools](sdk_with_carto.md)
* [Loading Map Data](loading_data.md)
* [Developer Guide to SDK Features](developer_guide.md)
* [Mobile Routing](routing.md)
* [API References](api_reference.md)

New files: @Aare- where do these files belong? (in the list above^. I need to know the exact order too. This is the chapter order in the live docs output)

* geocoding.md
* packager_manager.md
* custom_offine_data.md
 
Currently not being pulled into live docs: 

* [Extension features](proextensions.md) Will be added for a future release?
* Offline Maps (mobile-sdk/doc/deprecated/offline_maps.md)
  **@Aare, we need to redirect any links to this file all the docs**

* Internal reference of code tab panes for Aare (mobile-sdk/doc/code_sample_block.js)
