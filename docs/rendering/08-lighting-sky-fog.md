# Sun, shadows, sky, fog

Scope: everything about how the scene is lit and what fills the frame beyond the ground.

## One resolution point

`all/native/components/StyleEnvironment.h` is where the app's options and the style's opinions are
merged, and **every consumer must go through it** or the ground and the sky end up lit differently:

- `resolveLighting(LightOptions, StyleEnvironment) -> ResolvedLighting` — sun direction, colour,
  intensity, ambient, and the shadow parameters (strength, bias, softness, distance, map size,
  cascade count, caster margin).
- `resolveFog(TerrainOptions, StyleEnvironment, ResolvedLighting) -> ResolvedFog` — colour, start
  distance, distance, with the colour **lit by the same sun** (dark at night, warm at a low sun).

The style wins wherever it has an opinion; the rest stays with the options. The first layer to define
a property wins, values are re-read every frame, so they may depend on the zoom.

Consumers: `TileRenderer` (→ vt uniforms), `BackgroundRenderer`, `SkyRenderer`, and
`MapRenderer::applyTerrainShadows`.

## The sun on the ground

The shared ground is the lit surface of the scene, so one directional light shades the whole map.
The lighting state must be resolved **before** the ground draws (`drawLayers` does this), because
each layer otherwise sets the sun from its own `onDrawFrame`, which runs after the ground — the
ground would light itself with the previous frame's sun.

A terrain paint **covers** the ground it is drawn on, so it carries the ground's sun and shadow as
well, from the geometric normal — not from the hillshade's own exaggerated slope. Lighting only the
surface underneath leaves the shading over it unlit, and since a shadow multiplies the lit colour,
nothing shows at all.

## Cast shadows

`MapRenderer::applyTerrainShadows` + `TerrainShadowMap` (all/native/renderers/utils/).

The caster pass draws **exactly the terrain surfaces that are about to be drawn on screen**, from the
sun, into a packed-depth texture; the surface shader then looks itself up in it. Casters and
receivers share one vertex shader and one elevation fetch, so the shadow geometry cannot disagree
with the rendered geometry.

Design points, each measured:

- **Cascades** (up to `TerrainShadowMap::MAX_CASCADES = 4`, default 3 × 1024). Each cascade fits its
  light box to **its own** piece of ground's relief, not the whole scene's — at a low sun that is
  what sets the box size.
- **The shadow sun is not always the lighting sun.** A shadow is as long as the caster is tall over
  `tan(altitude)`: at 9° a 700 m hill throws 4.4 km, a 2 km massif 13 km. The light box stretches by
  the same factor, so the cascade ladder goes coarse (31/53/62 m texels at z12.3 t60, against 11 m
  bounded) and the shadows need casters far outside the drawn cover — what reaches the screen is a
  grey wash that appears and disappears with the cover. The **shadow pass alone** floors the sun
  altitude at 15°, keeping the azimuth, which caps shadow length at ~3.7× the relief. N·L lighting
  keeps the true sun, so a low sun still reads as a low sun.
- **Caster margin.** Casters are taken from the cover plus a ring of neighbours: a mountain just off
  screen still throws its shadow into the view, and without the margin its shadow vanishes as you
  zoom in and it leaves the visible set.
- The map is **snapped and cached** so a stationary camera does not re-render it.

**Current state: cast shadows are switched OFF on the shared ground.**
`applyTerrainShadows(..., castShadows = false, ...)` — the light, the boxes and the caster pass are
all wired, but with the pass enabled the map reads as scattered **shadow acne** instead of cast
shadows. Half-working shadows are worse than none. To work on it, flip that argument to true.

Tangram-ng has **no** terrain shadows at all, so there is nothing to copy here — this is one of the
few places the fork is ahead of the reference and therefore on its own.

## Sky

`SkyRenderer` draws a full-screen ray-direction quad before everything else, and reports whether it
drew (if it did, the legacy sky band is skipped).

Apps can replace the body with `SkyOptions::setShaderSource`. The wrapper declares
`u_sunDir`, `u_sunColor`, `u_skyColor`, `u_horizonColor`, `u_groundColor`, `u_fogColor`,
`u_fogBlend`, `u_time`, `u_zoom` and a `fogAmount(rayDir)` helper — **redeclaring any of them is a
compile error and the renderer silently falls back to the built-in sky**, which is the usual reason a
custom sky "does nothing".

Two implementation notes: it uses `glGetUniformLocation` with `>= 0` guards (see
[03-vt-renderer.md](03-vt-renderer.md#shaders)), and it draws from a **client-side array**, so any
renderer that leaves a `GL_ARRAY_BUFFER` bound makes the sky quad fly off screen.

## Fog and the background plane

Fog is applied by the vt shaders (ground, content, paint) from `setFog(color, startDistance,
distance)` in internal units, and by the sky through `fogAmount`. Because both come from
`resolveFog`, the horizon matches.

`BackgroundRenderer` draws the flat z=0 plane that fills the view past the terrain and past
`TerrainOptions::ViewDistanceFactor`. It uses `Options::getBackgroundBitmap()` — **not** the CartoCSS
`Map { background-color }`, which is why changing the style background does not tint it.

`ViewDistanceFactor` ends the ground; pair it with fog or it ends on a hard edge.
